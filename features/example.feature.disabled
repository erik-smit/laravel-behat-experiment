Feature: Testing
  In order to teach Behat
  As a teacher
  I want to demonstrate how install and create features

  Scenario: Home Page
    Given I am on the homepage
    Then I should see "Laravel"

  Scenario: Dashboard is locked to guests
    When I go to "home" 
    Then the url should match "login"
    And I can do something with Laravel
